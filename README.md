# WTWR (WHAT TO WEAR) API WEATHER APP: Project Description

For this project we created a full stack web app that allowed users
to depict how to dress depending on weather conditions. 

Users Functionality: ADD, UPDATE, and DELETE clothing items. As well as like or dislike clothing items. They can also register or login to have their data(which would include your own profile that you can sign in whenever you choose to give you an idea of what to wear based on your weather condition) saved once prompted. With the functionality of being able to sign up and login users can also edit their profile, change avatar, and name if liked.
